# pypy2

## Installation

In order to build pypy, you will need the python2 library of pycparser.
You can install it with the following command:

`$ pip2 install --user pycparser`

This will only install it for your current user, and it is safe to remove this
after pypy is finished building.

`$ pip2 uninstall pycparser`
